# Analysis of Chest X-Ray images
Neural networks have revolutionised image processing in several different domains. Among these is the field of medical imaging. In the following notebook, we will get some hands-on experience in working with Chest X-Ray (CXR) images.

The objective of this exercise is to identify images where an "effusion" is present. This is a classification problem, where we will be dealing with two classes - 'effusion' and 'nofinding'. Here, the latter represents a "normal" X-ray image.

Models have been build/trained using resnet and below is the comparisions for the same.
